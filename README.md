# The Music Gallery Booking Site
This is the webpage I created for the fourth milestone project(Fullstack frameworks with django)at code institute, diploma in Software Development. I wanted to make a music concert booking system. The inspiration for this, is that music is one of my big hobbies. It is also a mobile responsive website. You can visit the website here:-----
The website has a landing page, booking page, edit and delete booking page and an about page with a CRUD(create, read, update and delete) focus for the user.

## Ui and Ux
## Research
I have a bachelor degree in music, and I have been on a stage several times. I have also attended several concerts as a listener. With this in mind, I would have liked a landing page, where you instantly knew it was a booking site. My experience and my analyse of the live venue scene, I would suggest an easy to use booking site. A clean and well looking site, where the users can book and edit or delete booked tickets. This kind of booking sites, can help small venue events with controlling how many people that will arrive at a concert.



## Owner's goal
* The owner wants the ability to control how many people that will arrive at a concert
* The owner wants the ability to have a total amount of tickets.
* The owner wants the ability to build the brand of the 'The Music Gallery.'




## User's goals
* The users would like to know how to contact the venue.
* The users would like to read about the venue.
* The users would like to read about the upcoming concert.
* The users would like to be able to order more than one ticket.
* The users wants an easy to use booking site.
* The users wants a safe to use booking site.
* The users would like to be able to book tickets.
* The users would like to be able to edit tickets.
* The users would like to be able to delete tickets.
* The users would like to register an account.
* The users would like to log in and log out of that account.
